1. Run the verification script
   
   ```bash
   node guide/server.js
   ```

   (Note: This will start the server. Open the URL in the log to view the interactive dashboard!)

   Alternatively, for a CLI check (if you kept the old script logic separate, but here we reuse the server for the "Real" experience):
   
   Run:
   ```bash
   node guide/verify_logic.js
   ```
