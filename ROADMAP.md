# 🗺️ Project Cosmos Roadmap

## 🟢 Level 1: The Builder (Foundations)
**Goal**: Build a "Second Brain" Knowledge Graph Application.
- [x] **Phase 1: The Shell** (React + Vite Setup)
- [x] **Phase 2: The Data Layer** (Node.js Markdown Parser)
- [x] **Phase 3: The Pivot** (Refactoring List -> Graph)

## 🟡 Level 2: The Operator (Advanced Agentic Engineering)
**Goal**: Stress-test the Agent with massive data and complex operations.

### Phase 4: The Marathon (Long Tasks) ⏳
**Scenario**: Ingesting 50+ unstructured text files.
- **Challenge**: The Agent must read, tag, and categorize content for 30+ minutes.
- **Skill**: Managing "Agent Stamina" and monitoring long-running processes.

### Phase 5: The Architect (Slash Commands) 🛠️
**Scenario**: Managing the growing graph.
- **Challenge**: Orphan nodes are cluttering the view.
- **Skill**: Building custom tools (`/prune`) to automate maintenance.

### Phase 6: The Crisis (Error Recovery) 😵‍💫
**Scenario**: The Graph Visualizer crashes due to bad data.
- **Challenge**: Debugging Agent output and fixing circular dependencies.
- **Skill**: "Human-in-the-loop" debugging.

### Phase 7: The Hazard (Turbo Mode) 🕳️
**Scenario**: Deduplicating notes.
- **Challenge**: The Agent tries to delete valid files.
- **Skill**: Identifying unsafe "Auto-Run" prompts and intervening.

## 🔴 Level 3: The Hive (Future) 🐝
**Goal**: Multi-Agent Collaboration.
- **Concept**: One Agent writes notes, another reviews them, a third links them.
