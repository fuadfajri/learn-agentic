# Project Cosmos: Full Curriculum Rewrite 🌌

**Yes, Level 1 will change.**
"Project Orbit" (Tasks/Workers) will be archived.
"Project Cosmos" (Knowledge Graph) becomes the new core journey.

We will rebuild the guide from scratch to follow this path:

## Phase 1: The Foundation (Level 1) 🏗️
*Goal: Build a working "Second Brain" interface.*

*   **Step 1: The Shell (React + Vite)**
    *   Setup the project. Install `react-force-graph`.
    *   *Concept*: Modern Frontend Setup.
*   **Step 2: The Data Layer (Node.js)**
    *   Build a script to read Markdown files from a `notes/` folder.
    *   Parse YAML Frontmatter (tags, links).
    *   *Concept*: File System I/O & Parsing.
*   **Step 3: The Pivot (Requirement Mistranslation) 🔄**
    *   **The Scenario**: You ask for a "Note Viewer". The Agent builds a boring textual list (Project A).
    *   **The Mistake**: "Wait, I meant a *Visual Graph* like Obsidian! (Project B)"
    *   **The Fix**: You don't delete everything. You use the Agent to *refactor* the frontend: *"Replace the List View with a Force Directed Graph, but keep the data loading logic."*
    *   **Lesson**: Fearless Refactoring. Changing direction without starting over.

*(At this point, the user has a cool, working app. This replaces the old "Orbit" guide.)*

## Phase 2: The Advanced Operator (Level 2) 🚀
*Goal: Stress-test the Agent with massive data and complex ops.*

*   **Step 4: The Marathon (Data Ingestion)**
    *   **Task**: "Ingest `raw_data/` (50 messy files). Categorize, tag, and rewrite them into `notes/`."
    *   **Lesson**: Long-running Agent tasks (30+ mins simulation). Watching the graph explode in size.
*   **Step 5: The Architect (Slash Commands)**
    *   **Task**: "Create a workflow to archive orphan notes."
    *   **Lesson**: Building administrative tools (`.agent/workflows/prune.md`).
*   **Step 6: The Crisis (Error Recovery)**
    *   **Task**: "The Graph is crashing." (Due to bad data/circular links generated by Agent).
    *   **Lesson**: Debugging Agent output and manually fixing the JSON/Markdown.
*   **Step 7: The Hazard (Turbo Mode)**
    *   **Task**: "Delete duplicates."
    *   **Lesson**: Catching the Agent before it deletes your actual notes (Auto-Run Risk).

## Execution Plan
1.  **Archive Orbit**: Move `guide/index.html` to `guide/orbit_legacy.html`.
2.  **Create New Guide**: Write a fresh `guide/index.html` for Cosmos.
3.  **New Assets**: We will need new "Solution Code" for the graph visualization (I can generate this).
