# Project Cosmos: Agentic Engineering Guide 🌌

Welcome to **Project Cosmos**.
This repository is a structured training ground for **Agentic Engineering** (Working effectively with AI Agents).

**The Mission**: Build a "Second Brain" Knowledge Graph Application using React, Node.js, and Agentic Workflows.

## 📂 Project Structure
This repository is organized to support a multi-device, professional workflow:

*   **`cosmos_app/`**: The Application Source Code.
    *   `client/`: React + Vite Frontend (Force Graph).
    *   `server/`: Node.js Backend (Markdown Parser).
    *   `notes/`: The raw data for your graph.
*   **`guide/`**: The Mission Control Dashboard (Interactive Instructions).
*   **`.agent/`**: Brain files for the AI (Context & Workflows).

## 🚀 How to Start
1.  **Launch Mission Control**:
    ```bash
    node guide/server.js
    ```
2.  Open **http://localhost:3333** in your browser.
3.  Follow the **Level 1 (Builder)** instructions to construct the app.
4.  Proceed to **Level 2 (Operator)** to stress-test your Agent skills.

## 🔄 Workflow
*   **Syncing Work**: Use the slash command `/sync` (or `git commit`) to save progress.
*   **Resuming Work**: Pull the repo, start the server, and tell the Agent to read `.agent/context.md`.

Happy Building! 🚀
