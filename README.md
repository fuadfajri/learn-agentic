# Orbit: Structured Agentic Engineering Guide

Welcome to **Project Orbit**. This repository is your training ground to experience **Structured Agentic Engineering**.

**The Mission**: Build a production-ready **AI Task Orchestration Platform** (Orbit) using React, Node.js, and Redis.
**Time Commitment**: ~2 Hours ⏱️

**The Real Goal**: Learn **Atomic Git Workflows**, **Context Management**, and **Verification Loops** to build complex software systematically.

## 🚀 How to Start

This guide is **Interactive**. You will run a local "Mission Control" dashboard that guides you through the phases:
1.  **The Architect** (Planning & Context)
2.  **The Engineer** (Backend & Queues)
3.  **The Frontend Specialist** (Dashboard & WebSockets)
4.  **The Verifier** (Security & Audit)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (v18+)
- (Optional) Redis (or you can use mocks)

### Launch Mission Control
1.  Open your terminal in this directory.
2.  Run the guide server:
    ```bash
    node guide/server.js
    ```
3.  Open **http://localhost:3333** in your browser.
4.  Follow the instructions on the dashboard and **Verify** your progress in real-time!

> **Tip**: You can also use the slash command `/verify` in the IDE chat if you have set up the workflow.

Happy Building! 🌌
